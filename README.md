# Movie Project

A responsive, user-friendly movie website where you can discover any movie you want. The project integrates data from the TMDb API, ensuring up-to-date movie content around the clock. It features an intuitive search bar for seamless movie discovery and selection, and leverages Firebase for user authentication, login management, and storage of user watchlists

Originally started as a fun project in my grade 12 CS class, the project has since undergone significant improvements with the addition of new features and enhancements. It was initially part of a larger private repository, but once the project was mostly completed, I moved it to this dedicated repo
