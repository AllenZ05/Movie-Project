# Movie Project

A responsive and user-friendly movie website to find any movie you want. Integrated data from the TMDb API for 24/7 up-to-date content. Implemented an intuitive search bar for effortless movie discovery and selection. Utilized Firebase for user authentication, login management, and storage of user's movies

Started off as a fun little project I would build in grade 12 CS, however I have vastly improved it and have added many new features in. 
Was originally part of a much larger repo (which is private), however, when I finished the project I moved it to this new repo
