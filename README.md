# Movie Project

Created a responsive and user-friendly movie website to find any movie you want. Integrated data from the TMDb API for up-to-date content including an overview, trailer, genre, ratings, release dates, directors, writers, and more. Implemented an intuitive search bar for effortless movie discovery and selection. Utilized Firebase for user authentication, login management, and storage of liked movies and movie watch-list. 

Was originally part of a much larger repo (which is private), however, when I finished the project I moved it to a new repo as the previous one could not be made public due to an API key leak, back when I was testing something out and made an oopsies :(
